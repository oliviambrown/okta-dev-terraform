# Managing Okta with  Terraform

Hello, I manage Okta in the GUI but I also make mistakes when managing.

Therefore, I want to learn how to manage infrastructure using code.

### Goals include
- Reducing change blast radii.
- Making predictable and trackable changes.
- Learning a new skill.

# How GitHub?
This GitHub repo is the main repository of the Okta configuration. 

The main branch will send the configuration to Spacelift to *terraform plan*. 

If the plan is successful, Spacelift will approve the change and *terraform apply* to make the change in Okta. 

# Branching?
- Need to learn how to manage and approve branch pulls.
- Currently commiting to the main branch.

Learning how to branch is needed so that others can propose changes.
