# okta-dev-terraform

Hello, I really like Okta but I also make a lot of mistakes when managing the work environment that I'm responsible for. Still learning ðŸ¥²

Therefore, I want flex my brain muscles and learn a bit of how other people manage Infrastucture. I want to automate my work and always track my changes.

# How GitHub?
This GitHub repo is the main repository of the Okta configuration. The main branch will send the configuration to spacelift.io to plan and if it's successful, I will approve spacelift to make the change in Okta. 

# Branching?
Not recommended because it helps keep the changes in one "line".

That includes:
- Reducing blast radii.
- Making predictable and trackable changes. 
- Learning a new skill that brings more experience.

Spacelift will be my primary IaC tool as that's what my current environment uses.
