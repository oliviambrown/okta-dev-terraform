# okta-dev-terraform

Hello, I really like Okta but I also make a lot of mistakes when managing the work environment that I'm responsible for. Still learning 🥲

Therefore, I want flex my brain muscles and learn a bit of how other people manage Infrastucture. I want to automate my work and always track my changes.

That includes:
- Reducing blast radii.
- Making predictable changes. 
- Learning a new skill that brings more experience.
